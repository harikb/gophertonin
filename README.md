GoBot based Melatonin generator for Gophers

Toy project for GopherCon 2016 - GoBot Hackathon, Wed Jul 13, 2016

Beyond the click-bait, it uses the MacOSX App f.lux via a Go server (running on that Mac) controlled by a GoBot enabled Go App running on an Edisson

Currently: The button toggles the screen between 2700K (Tungsten) and 6500 (Day light)
